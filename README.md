# Overview
This is an implementation of aspects of a 2D Star Wars game using the Allegro5 game programming library for C++. I worked on this project while taking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6B459AAE1642C8B4">Allegro5 tutorials</a> online.

The X-Wing fighter's position on the screen is controlled by the mouse pointer. If it crashes into the stationary asteroid, an explosion sprite is displayed and an irritating sound is played. The sound is also played when the X-Wing crashes against the edges of the screen. All this goes on with the Death Star in the background and the Star Wars title song playing on loop.
