The X-Wing fighter's position on the screen is controlled by the mouse pointer. If it crashes into the stationary astroid, an explosion sprite is displayed and an irritating sound is played. The sound is also played when the X-Wing crashes against the edges of the screen. All this goes on with the Death Star in the background and the Star Wars title song playing on loop.
